Notes on Shell Scripting, Emacs, vi and Git

## Reference
A great deal of this note is my jotting while studying on the [Linux Commands Platform](https://www.linuxcommand.org). This is more of a compressed jotting of important notes to get you going on a glance.

**Happy learning** and importantly, ***happy hacking!***
